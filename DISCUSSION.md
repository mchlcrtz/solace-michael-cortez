# Discussion

If I had more time, I would separate the client and backend into distinct services, move to Elasticsearch for better full-text search capabilities, and add more features to allow users to find the most relevant advocate for them, including advanced filtering, smart matching algorithms, and better search capabilities. I would also add features that would allow users to save advocates and contact them through the application, such as favorites, in-app messaging, and appointment scheduling. A full list of changes are in [CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md).
